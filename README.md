# Conference notes

I'm usually trying to take notes during talks on conferences. Writing things down makes memorizing things easier, at least for me. And somehow I got used to not going back to slides after a conference even if they're available.

This repository includes notes for conferences I'm attending and will probably grow over time.

If you want to participate:

* Fork the repository
* Add your notes, preferably in Markdown
* Send me a pull request

The directory structure is: `conference_name/year/your_name.md`
