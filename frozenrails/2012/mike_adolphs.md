### *Mind your metaphors* - [Amanda Wagener](https://twitter.com/a_wagener)

#### Topics

* Metaphors
  * The benefits
    * Make things easier
    * Simplify communicating with people
  * The dangers
    * Somehow shorthanded
    * Simplifies too much
    * Often includes unwanted dependencies
* An example:
  * Sprints should better be called strawls
  * *no more examples?*
* **Think about the metaphors you're using!**

#### Techniques

* Mostly text, centered
* Website/Wikipedia excerpt
* A couple quotes
* Images, full screen

### *ZeroMQ: Scriptable sockets* - [Lourens Naude](https://twitter.com/methodmissing)
Slides available on [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/u/methodmissing/p/zeromq-sockets-on-steroids-1)

#### Topics

* Why?
  * Because even in 2012 it's still too expensive to maintain integration points
* Socket I/O problems:
  * Strong developer profile required
  * Lack of portability
* What's a ZeroMQ socket?
  * Super (scriptable) socket
  * Asynchronous connect
  * Socket types:
    * Request <-> Reply
    * Push <-> Subscribe
    * Push <-> Pull (Pipeline)
* *pretty fast, can't keep up taking notes. He mainly shows ZeroMQ features*
* *Code dive with Ruby bindings on socket creation and more. Sorry, the pace left me stranded.*

#### Techniques

* Mostly text, lots of diagrams
* No colorized source code

### *Designing Hypermedia APIs*, [Steve Klabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik)

#### Topics

* Most people think short-term
* Flexibility and stability needs to be balanced the right way
* Adapters
  * fog as middleware
* **Something's coupled when it breaks if you change it**
* Solution: **Radical decoupling**
  * Media type as the backbone of decoupling

* Server and client software can evolve apart from the media type
* Examples:
  * GitHub pagination `"rel":"next"`
  * ID->URI
* More information on [Designing Hypermedia APIs](http://designinghypermediaapis.com)

#### Techniques

* Header/Content separation
* Couple diagrams, almost no colorized code

### *Fighting code smells* - Ruby code analysis tools, [Dennis Ushakov](http://twitter.com/en_Dal)

#### Topics

* **Pareto principle** (20% new code, 80% modifications)
* Code that smells:
  * Runtime errors/warnings
  * Dead code
  * Copy/paste'd code
  * Complex method bodies
  * Code style violations
  * Framework pattern violations
* Code quality tools:
  * Static tools
    * inspect code without launching
    * 100% no side effects, but hard to implement and not Rails compliant
    * Existing tools: Reek, flog, flay, Roodi, metrics_fu
    * Metrics foo provides aggregate resulrs for flay, flog, reek, roodi
  * Runtime tools
    * Inspect code by launching
    * Cope well with DSL magic
    * may have side effects
    * Existing tools:
      * Code testing:
        * Test::Unit
        * rspec/Cucumber
      * Code coverage
        * rcov, simplecov
        * heckle
        * RubyMine
* Morale: **Use static analysis tools, test and try RubyMine**

### Off the tracks, [Nick Sutterer](https://twitter.com/apotonick)

#### Topics

* *Off the tracks literally: Nick begins his talk with telling a story and Elton John in the back*
* Nick wants more object orientation in Rails
* Example: A model with having a send_sms method in the user model
* **"Fat model, skinny controller"**
* *I think the morale is: Don't be afraid of making use of more classes, right? Right.*
* *Pretty lengthy example. Unable to follow since the talk's pretty weird, I'm sorry.*

#### Techniques

* Music, campfire on screen
* Mostly Google Image search images

### Post-Rails? Composable apps with a first-class API, [Brandur Leach](https://brandur.org)

#### Topics

* Keep your core application small and agile
* `BUTC` (Break up the core) is a learning from Salesforce splitting their Perl monolith into smaller pieces
* Split huge rails apps into smaller ones
* Let them talk via APIs to each other
* Examples from Heroku
  * Dashboard
  * Manager (Manager Web -> Manager API -> Core API)
* Take care of reusability
* **A good API is a reusable API**
* Favour Service Orientied Architecture (SOA) to ease the scaling pain
* APIs are important at least as the corresponding web application
* Benefits
  * More people are able to maintain different parts of the platform
  * Maintenance is easier, implementation of new features as well (Increasing happiness)
* **Lessons learned:**
  * Testing becomes harder, more stubs needed
  * Yehuda Katz's [artifice](http://rubygems.org/gems/artifice) or [excon-artifice](http://rubygems.org/gems/artifice-excon) for routing requests to a Rack application

### Deploy, scale and sleep at night with JRuby, [Joe Kutner](https://twitter.com/codefinger)

Slides on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/jkutner/deploy-scale-and-sleep-at-night-with-jruby)

#### Topics

* *He's the writer of 'Deploying with JRuby'*
* **Sysadmin is the worst job in the industry**
* Deploying to a JVM is about making life for sysadmins easier
* The current application infrastructure is cumbersome to scale
* **Passenger or Unicorn are not solving the underlying problem they just ease the pain.**
* It comes down to: Ruby Thread -> [GIL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Interpreter_Lock) -> Kernel Thread
* **Steve Klabnik: 'Will Ruby ever get rid of GIL?', Matz: 'No' at RubyConf last year**
* Deploying to a JVM solves the problem
  * No thread managing anymore, only processes
* *showing benchmarks from [TorqueBox](http://torquebox.org/)*
* To know what needs to be changed in order to use JRuby use the [jruby-lint](https://github.com/jruby/jruby-lint) gem
* Various JVM solutions
  * [Warbler](http://kenai.com/projects/warbler/pages/Home)
    * Advantages
      * Creates warfile which then can be served by Tomcat/Jetty/WebLogic/JBoss
      * Warfiles can be signed
      * Deployment is fast
      * Makes `bundle install` obsolete
    * Disadvantages
      * Need to generate a warfile for each change
  * [Triniad](http://rubygems.org/gems/trinidad) (lightweight Ruby webserver)
    * Runs RoR application in an embedded Apache Tomcat container
    * Deployment still capistrano based
    * Brings a couple of extensions like a job scheduler (Quartz), worker (Resque) with it
  * [TorqueBox](http://torquebox.org)
    * `torquebox run`, then `torquebox deploy`
    * **The real power of torquebox comes from its subsystems**
    * Includes clustering, load-balancing and high availability out-of-the-box
  * A couple other solutions: Mizuno, Puma, torquebox-lite
  * Cloud companies provide a wide range of solutions
* Morale: *read his [book](http://pragprog.com/book/jkdepj/deploying-with-jruby)* and use `JRubyFrozenKutner` for a discount
